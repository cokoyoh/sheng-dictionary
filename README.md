 ## About Sheng Slang
Sheng Slang is built mainly with the intention of having a localised version of urban dictionary. You will appreciate the fact that there are many common words 
that you hear but no one seem to really understand their meaning. For example the phrase 'Mbogi ni ya Kimonyoski', what does it mean? I've been asking around but no one seem to understand. 


--------------------------------------------
Well, it's time we defined these words. For posterity. I call dibs on #Doktari. Gideon, I see you...
